## [Unreleased]

## [7.0.1]
### Fixed
- Fix issue introduced in 7.0.0 where QR Keyrings constructor erroneously receives an empty options object as argument ([#136](https://github.com/MetaMask/KeyringController/pull/136))

## [7.0.0]
### Added
- Add forget Keyring method for some hardware devices ([#124](https://github.com/MetaMask/KeyringController/pull/124))
- Add `@lavamoat/allow-scripts` ([#109](https://github.com/MetaMask/KeyringController/pull/109))

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Bump eth-hd-keyring to latest version ([#132](https://github.com/MetaMask/KeyringController/pull/132))
    - When calling the `addNewKeyring` method, an options object can no longer be passed containing a `numberOfAccounts` property without also including a `mnemonic`. Not adding any option argument will result in the generation of a new mnemonic and the addition of 1 account derived from that mnemonic to the keyring.
- When calling `createNewVaultAndKeychain` all keyrings are cleared first thing ([#129](https://github.com/MetaMask/KeyringController/pull/129))
- Validate user imported seedphrase across all bip39 wordlists ([#77](https://github.com/MetaMask/KeyringController/pull/77))
